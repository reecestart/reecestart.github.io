Hi, my name is Reece Denne and welcome to my site.

This site is hosted on [Github][Github] which is where I keep my public [AWS Python][AWS-Python] scripts, my [AWS PowerShell][AWS-PowerShell] scripts, my [Windows PowerShell][Windows-PowerShell] scripts, and any other projects I am working on.

This site was generated using [Jekyll][Jekyll]: a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

I am currently living in London, UK with my wife.

If you would like to reach out to me for an opportunity please email [reece@denne.io][reece@denne.io]
