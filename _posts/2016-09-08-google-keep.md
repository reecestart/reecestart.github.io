I've been using [Google Keep][Google-Keep] for about two years now almost daily.

That's 41 pages, 3919 words, or 27153 characters of notes. You can determine these values by either by [Selecting All your notes and Copying to a Google Doc][Selecting-All-your-notes-and-Copying-to-a-Google-Doc] or by using the [Takeout Google][Takeout-Google] service.

So why should you use Google Keep? Well if you're looking for a note keeping service that is available from your mobile ([offline read and edit as well][offline-read-and-edit-as-well]) or any browser than I would recommend Google Keep.

A quick look at the alternatives:

<b>OneNote</b>

I've tried [Microsoft's OneNote][Microsofts-OneNote] and I like the scrapbooking type interface where you have different media and can create notes centered around a whole concept. Where I see OneNote fall down is the time it takes to get into OneNote (sometimes requiring a Microsoft Live account sign in) and the app itself has a few too many bells and whistles for me when all I'm after is a simple, quick note taking and retrieving service.

<b>Evernote</b>

An elephant never forgets, a good choice for [Evernote][Evernote]'s logo. This service isn't quite up-to-speed with the '<i>snappyness</i>' I require from notes; I want to quickly record them, or quickly search on them. The Evernote service really comes into usefulness with their premium features (like [attached document search][attached-document-search]) but if you're not looking to pay a subscription this will be a deal-breaker.

<b>Google Keep</b>

The key points that <i>keep</i> me coming back to Google Keep:

<ol>
<li>Quick capture of links for further reading/experimenting from Twitter for iOS</li>
<li>Offline search of notes</li>
<li>Offline capture of notes</li>
<li>Fast return of search results</li>
<li>Simple interface; and</li>
<li>Free</li>
</ol>

A final note - don't use a service like Google Keep or any of the alternatives above to store passwords. If you are going to store passwords anywhere I recommend a service like [LastPass][LastPass] and use a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) service like [Authy][Authy] wherever possible.
